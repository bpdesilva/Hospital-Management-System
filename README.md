# Hospital-Management-System
A 1st year project developed for HND in Computing.

### Scenario 

Health Care hospital currently uses a manual system for the management and maintenance of critical information. The current system requires numerous paper forms, with data stores spread throughout the hospital management infrastructure. Often information (on forms) is incomplete, or does not follow management standards. 
Multiple copies of the same information exist in the hospital and may lead to inconsistencies in data in various data stores. There are number of documents to be maintained in the Health Care hospital and this information typically involves; patient personal information and medical history, staff information, room and ward scheduling, staff scheduling, operating theater scheduling and various facilities waiting lists. 
All of this information must be managed in an efficient and cost wise fashion so that the resources can be managed effectively. The reception module handles various inquiries about the patient's admission and discharge details, and the patient's movements within the hospital.
Assume that you are the web developer hired by the Health Care Hospital, to propose, and engineer a low cost but yet powerful and complete Hospital Management System (HMS) for the scenario given above. Suggest and implement important functionalities and features to the system by identifying system functionalities.
The new system is to control the following information

* patient information
* room availability
* staff and operating room schedules
* patient invoices


These services are to be provided in an efficient, cost effective manner, with the goal of reducing the time and resources currently required for such tasks.
